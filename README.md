My solution to the Technical Challenge posed by Reverb.com
http://reverb.com/page/dev-apprentice-challenge

I considered the effort complete after about 4 hours of work. Remaining
refactoring opportunities and possible features are noted for discussion.

Global Refactoring Opportunities:
* Namespace code
* Move sorting specs from parser to sorter
* Test interface between parser and sorter
